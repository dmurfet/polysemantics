# polysemantics
The polynomial semantics of linear logic interprets linear logic programs as matrices of polynomials. We compute these matrices using Singular and Python. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:d.murfet@unimelb.edu.au).

# Installation & Usage

First you need a working installation of the commutative algebra package [Singular](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/). Singular is available for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X and is [easy to install](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/index.php/singular-download.html).

For an explanation of the mathematics behind this code, see [Murfet](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2650).
